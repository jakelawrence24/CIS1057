Homework 51. The initialization of sentinel-controlled loops and endfile-controlled loops are the same because they both follow identical syntax with while and for loops. The initialization of sentinel-controlled loops and endfile-controlled loops are different because they exit in different manners . The repetition tests of sentinel-controlled loops and endfile-controlled loops are the same because they aren’t bound by a counting variable . The repetition tests of sentinel-controlled loops and endfile-controlled loops are different because sentinel loops compare values to finish loops, where endfile loops run until the endfile is reached . The update tests of sentinel-controlled loops and endfile-controlled loops are the same because they both move through the inputted values onto the next data value. The update tests of sentinel-controlled loops and endfile-controlled loops are different because sentinel loops are parsing through data where end file loops are parsing through files .  2. int sum, n;do{      printf(“Enter temperature: “);      scanf(“%d”, &n);            if(n == 275)      	break;      sum += n	}while(1);		printf(“%d\n”, sum);3.  #include <stdio.h>#define SPECIAL_SLOPE 0.0intmain(void){ 		double slope, y2, y1, x2, x1;       printf("Enter 4 numbers separated by spaces."); 	printf("\nThe last two numbers cannot be the ");       printf("same, but\nthe program terminates if ");       printf("the first two are.\n");       printf("\nEnter four numbers> ");      //Scans in 4 2 8 4 -> slope is set to .50       scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &y2, &y1, &x2, &x1);      //Scans in 1 4 2 1 -> slope is set to -3      //Scans in 9 3 3 1 -> slope is set to 3      //Scans in -22 10 8 2 -> slope is set to -5.33      //Scans in 3 3 4 5-> slope is set to 0      // cause the loops to end 	for (slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1);       slope != SPECIAL_SLOPE;       slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)) { 	printf("Slope is %5.2f.\n", slope);       printf("\nEnter four more numbers> ");       scanf("%lf%lf%lf%lf", &y2, &y1, &x2, &x1);       } return (0);}4.  #include <stdio.h>#define SPECIAL_SLOPE 0.0int main(void){double slope, y2, y1, x2, x1;printf(“Enter 4 numbers separated by spaces.”);printf(“\nThe last two numbers cannot be the “);printf(“same, but\nthe program terminates if “);printf(“the first two are.\n”);printf(“\nEnter four numbers> “);scanf(“%lf%lf%lf%lf”, &y2, &y1, &x2, &x1);slope = (y2 – y1) / (x2 – x1);while(slope != SPECIAL_SLOPE){	printf(“Slope is %5.2f.\n”, slope);	printf(“\nEnter four more numbers> “);	scanf(“%lf%lf%lf%lf”, &y2, &y1, &x2, &x1);	slope = (y2 – y1) / (x2 – x1);      }      return 0;}5. count = 0;for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){	scanf(%d”, &x);	if(x == i)		++count;}6. for(i = n; I < max; ++i)7. #include<ctype.h>do{int n;printf(“Enter a number: “);scanf(“%d” &n);if(n >= ‘0’ || n <= 15)	break;	while(isDigit(n));      Christopher LawrenceCIS1057Professor Joseph JupinOctober 12, 2016
